# PyUQ : Uncertainty Quantification and Data Assimilation - A Python library



### Introduction

PyUQ is a python library for uncertainty quantifcation and data assimilation, combining the fretures of c-ANOVA, POD and Krigging. 

Sensitivty analysis is perfromed using Sobol indices, and sampling is provided Sobal sequence

This is library was developed during the author's time at M2P2 Lab, France under supervision of Prof. Pierre Sagaut.  

### Features
